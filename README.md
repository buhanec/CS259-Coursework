CS259 Coursework
================

Solution to practical assignment for Warwick's CS259 course in 2014/15.

Task
----

Parse and evaluate a language with a given syntax. Syntax to be defined at some point in the future, if I stumble across the assignment. Or just check the Tests folder for examples.

A couple of things that might be useful when browsing Tests:

 - One function definition per line
 - Function definitions follow `DEF <FN NAME> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3...]]] { <operations> } ;`
 - Function calls follow `<FN NAME>([arg1 [arg2 [arg3...]]])`
 - Operations have no spaces (e.g. `<op1>+<op2>`)
 - `MAIN` function has to be defined and is the entry point
